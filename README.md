# BWT-variants-for-string-collections
This repository contains all scripts to reproduce the experiments showed in the paper "A theoretical and experimental analysis of BWT variants for string collections" presented at CPM 2022.

# Usage

### Download and Compile

```console
git clone https://github.com/davidecenzato/BWT-variants-for-string-collections.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
git submodule update --init --remote ropebwt2
```
Compile the 3 tools, Big-BWT, PFP-eBWT and ropeBWT2 downloaded as submodules. See ./BWTvar/compute_BWTs_instructions.md for the full instructions.
```console
cd bigbwt
make

cd pfpebwt
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

cp ropeBWT2main/main.c ./ropebwt2/
cd ropebwt2
make
```
Install SRA-toolkit, SeqKit tools and Levenshtein python package. See also ./data/download_instructions.md. 

### Datasets setup:

Most of the data can be downloaded using the following command,
```console
python3 DownloadData.py
```
The complete download instructions, including all dependencies, can be found in ./data/download_instruction.md. All datasets
will be stored in ./data subdirectory.

### BWT variants computation:

All BWT variants can be computed using the following command,
```console
python3 compute_all_bwt_variants.py --all
```
The complete instructions for computing the BWT variants, including all dependencies, can be found in ./BWTvar/compute_BWTs_instruction.md. All BWT variants will be stored in ./BWTvar subdirectory.

### Computation of Hamming distance, edit distance and number of runs:

All distances and number of runs can be computed using the following command,

```console
python3 compute_all_dist_runs.py --all
```
Computing the edit distance on long sequence datasets can take long time (> 24h), in case you can avoid computing the edit distance on those datasets use the following command,

```console
python3 compute_all_dist_runs.py --all --noeditlong
```
All results will be stored in ./results subdirectory.

### Computation of the dataset properties:

The properties of all datasets can be computed usign the following command,
```console
python3 -u compute_all_dataset_properties.py --all 
```
All results will be stored in ./results/dataset_properties.txt
